This repository contains code and files for my BIO695 final project. The files are as follows:
BIO695_final_annotated_code.R - This has all the R code to produce all figures and run all tests. The sections are annotated. Start by installing all packages and then start at the "Start here if using data downloaded from github" section
BIO695_sensor_locations.csv - CSV file which contains lat and long for all sesnors. USed when creating the map of receivers and sensors in the last section of code
Bio695_Filtered_animal_data.csv - CSV file which contains tagged animal info. Used for data preprocessing in first part of code (isn't supposed to be used)
Bio695_filtered_rec_loc - CSV file which contains receiver info, including lat and long, serial numbers, and habitat type
CAWSShapefile.*** - These are spatial files used for creating maps in R. They should be put into a separate folder
Rec_*****_DO.csv - CSV files of DO and temp for each recevier. They should be put into a seperate folder
bass_det_final.csv - CSV file containing detections of only largemouth bass during the study length. This is the first dataset to start off with.
